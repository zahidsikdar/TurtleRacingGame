# TurtleRacingGame

This Python code sets up a turtle racing game. It uses the Turtle graphics library to create six turtles of different colors on a virtual race track. The user is prompted to bet on a turtle's color. When the user makes a bet, the race begins. Each turtle moves randomly forward in steps, and the first turtle to cross the finish line triggers the end of the race. If the user's bet matches the winning turtle's color, they win; otherwise, they lose. The race graphics are displayed using the Turtle graphics window. The user can click on the window to close it after the race.
